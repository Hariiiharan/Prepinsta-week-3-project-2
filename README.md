Data cleaning and manipulations using Pandas and Numpy
Prepinsta Data Analysis Week 3

This project involves data analysis of a dataset using the Pandas and Numpy libraries for manipulation and analysis, and Seaborn for visualization to clearly understand the data. This analysis helps in extracting meaningful insights and patterns from the data. We are dealing with conversion of 'tsv' to 'csv' of the 'chipotle' dataset.
